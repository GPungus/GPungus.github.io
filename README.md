This webpage serves as an artificial shopfront containing 2 separate pages, one operating as a homepage with a few photo elements, and the second operating as a more specific look into the services offered and the pricing. At the bottom of the page is the location along with some contact information so that interested customers can contact via their method of choice. It contains some simple stylistic choices like a photo background and centered text with boxes.
