The purpose of this webpage is to serve as a brief personal introduction about me detailing my hobbies, interests and my aspirations with my schooling and my career. As I progress through this course, hopefully I will become more proficient in HTML and understand how to customize and build my own webpages using HTML and CSS. Along with learning to build webpages, I am using this course to gain a sense of familiarity in GitHub so that I can hopefully be comfortable with it when I am required to use it in the near and far future.
