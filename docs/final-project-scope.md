# Full Project Proposal

## Project Purpose
--- 
The purpose of this project is to provide a fully functional prototype website showing off a my chosen topic, which is a small fictional DS repair shop. This project will serve as a tying together of ideas and concepts that we have learned throughout the entire semester

## Description
---
This webpage will be a fictional shopfront detailing the name, purpose, and showing off a few products that are being offered on the site. The site will be 2 pages, and the first page will primarily be detailing the fictional shop with the second page being the offerings and services provided by the shopfront

It is not required to look particularly pretty, but it is in my best interest to try and make it look as nice as I can, as I would like to push myself outside of my comfort zone when designing this page

## Desired Results
---

- 2 Pages
- Inclusion of images
- Font and formatting for ease of reading
- FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- Color

## Exclusions
---

- Interactable items (pictures will just be static)
- Moving elements
- higher level CSS design elements
- final product

## Priorities
---
The website will prioritize functionality over form, as it is important to make sure that everything works, and going back to make things looks nicer later is always an option. The website should be simple, and it should not contain more than two pages. Throughout the process of this project, I intend to challenge myself by incorporating new design elements, but these elements should still be simple in nature, and within the scope of my capabilities. I guess I am trying to avoid biting off more than I can chew, while still trying to push myself and create a product that I can look back on and be proud of

## Acceptance Criteria
---
