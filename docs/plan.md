# Project Plan

The idea of this project is to make sure I am focusing on delivering what is expected without spreading myself thin and without taking on a project that is too large for myself.

My goal is to have a fully functional, passable website that will serve as the framework for the project and will present my idea of a shopfront while maintaining a level of simplicity that makes the end product achievable for my current skillset

## Risk Analysis

Before getting into the nitty gritty of the project, it is important to highlight some risks, and discuss some ways that the risks will be mitigated using the TAME framework.

A few of the possible risks that could potentially pop up and or already have popped up:
- Scope of project too large
- Messing up HTML doc
- Messing up CSS doc
- Creative block
- Limited stylization 

Using TAME (Transfer, Accept, Mitigate, Eliminate), we can rectify some of the risks listed above. Unfortunately, since this is a solo project, the Transfer framework is not a possibility, as outsourcing my work to a third party would be considerd unethical in this instance. Instead, I will be focusing on the other 3.

With the potential risk of messing up the HTMl and CSS, there is nothing to do but to accept this risk and carry forwards with the understanding that mistakes are a possibility, but I will have to be diligent and make sure that I do not break things too badly. 

The best way to deal with the scope of the project being too large is to eliminate the risk altogether by limiting myself before embarking on the project. This is why I am limiting myself to only two pages, with only 3 embedded images. This way I can guarantee that the project's bounds stay within the limit of my abilities.
