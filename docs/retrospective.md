# In retrospect

Over the short week that I worked on this project, there were a few things that I feel went well, and there were a few things that I feel did not. Ultimately, I think that I managed my time well enough, but I feel as though I could've been more intentional and specific with the allotment of my time. I think that I have a tendency to have an idea of what I want to do and how I would like to distribute my time, but when it comes to putting these ideas into something concrete, like a schedule, I tend to struggle.

## Things that went well

- composition of the markdown documents
- brainstorming process
- extraneous peer review process (my friends)
- sourcing of images 

## Things that went poorly

- centering of things within the HTML
- styling the page how I wanted within my CSS capabilities
- planning process
- intended peer review (missed the date)
