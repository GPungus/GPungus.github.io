        <h2>Computer Science/Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>It's hard to define a goal for my career, or even for this course. I struggle to paint a larger picture outside of just completing the course and furthering my education. The same goes for my professional work. I often aim to do well, but not too well. I don't really define any points of growth or achievable goals for myself. With that being said, I think that what I aim to get out of this course is a glimpse into what it is like to be a programmer. </p>
        <p>I know that I have always been fascinated with cybersecurity, and I believe that I would like to work in a career where I can further that interest. I have no understanding of what it takes to be an adequate computer scientist or prgrammer, or cybersecurity analyst, but what I do know is that I have had a passion for computers since I was 4 years old, and I believe that this is what will captivate me most.</p>
